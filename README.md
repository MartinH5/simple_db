# simple_db
## Martin Hansen

This is the first asignment in the Database course from CPH Business SOFT. The purpose is the following: 

Build a simple_db in the programming language of your choice (Java).
  1. Implement a Hashmap-based index.
  2. Implement functionality to store your data on disk in a binary file.
  3. Implement functionality to read your data from disk again, so that you can reinstantiate your database after a shutdown.
  
To use test this application, you need to import the project into a Java Editor (Netbeans, Eclipse etc.) and run it. There's 3 commands you can use.

1. Read               --- This command reads the hashmap from the file.
2. Insert             --- This command inserts the current hashmap into the file (overwrites).
3. Generate Test Data --- This command generates some test data in the memory.
